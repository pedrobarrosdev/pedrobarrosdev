Hello! I much appreciate you're interest in getting to know me!

* I am a self-taught software developer student, currently taking part in Rocketseat's Ignite Bootcamp for Node.js.
* In 2020, as I was writing my thesis on Blockchain & Foreign Trade for my Foreign Trade's bachelor's degree, I rekindled my passion for technology and this time, there was no stopping me, except the excruciating anxiety I was feeling from realizing t I was about to graduate in an area I didn't want to be working in... but everything worked out just fine!
* Since graduating I've been studying non-stop everything I can to become a software developer.
* This year I started my journey to transitioning careers with Web Development, briefly crossed paths with Mobile Development (Android), but now I'm back on track with Web Development.

<h5>Other than that...</h5>

* I speak 3 languages: Portuguese (native), English (fluent), and French (advanced).
* I am 50% deaf on my left ear as a result from birth complications, but don't worry, I hear just fine... most of the time.
* I ‚ù§Ô∏è a **good** wine, a **good** movie, a **good** rock song, and plenty of other **good** stuff!
